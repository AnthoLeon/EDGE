<p>EDGE is an easy to use, highly adaptable bioinformatics platform that allows laboratories to quickly analyze and interpret genomic sequence data that can be accessed and used from anywhere in the world. The platform allows users to address a wide range of use cases including assay validation and the characterization of novel biological threats, clinical samples, and complex environmental samples. The goals of the EDGE platform are:</p>

<ul>
<li>To analyze real world use cases</li>
<li>Make use of open source (free) software tools</li>
<li>Run analyses from practically anywhere</li>
<li>Provide remote bioinformatics specialist assistance</li>
</ul>
<p>
EDGE was designed for the role of a user-friendly bioinformatics solution that can be provided to OCONUS labs to facilitate successful adoption of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies. This is critical because overseas deployment of sequencers allows the technology to get closer to the acquisition point of samples, thereby avoiding political issues associated with removal of strains/samples from host contries. In addition, sequencing specimens closer to the source can also decrease the timeline involved in identification and characterization of unknown agents, and acquisition of information that can be used against global health risks.

<h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Update Log</h3>
<p>
  What's New? <b>07/30/2015</b>:
  <ul>
    <li>Added SRA input for SNP phylogenetic analysis</li>
    <li>Added "Upload Files" module to upload custom fastq files</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Using EDGE</h3>
<p>
To run EDGE, go to the EDGE webpage at <a href="https://www.bioedge.lanl.gov">www.bioedge.lanl.gov</a>. You will need to create an account in order to start a project, which you can do with the icon in the top right corner. Once you've created an account and have logged in, you can start a project. From the menu on the left, click "Run EDGE". This will open a page titled "Input your sample", and from here you will see a list of drop down menus that will allow you to label your project, input FASTQ files, and select the tools you would like to use. Pre-Processing, Assembly and Annotation, and Taxonomy Classification are turned on by default. 

While your project is running you can watch it's progress and system usage using the Job Progress sidebar, which opens using the icon in the top right corner. 

For those that want to run EDGE offline, installation instructions can be found in our documentation, which can be accessed <a href="here">https://edge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html</a>. There is also a link to the documentation on the EDGE website.
</p>

<h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Output</h3>
<p>
  Once your project is completed, EDGE will create an output report that contains a brief summary of the run, along with a list of drop down menus that show the EDGE tools used and detailed reports. The final data is listed in these menus and visualized through a tool called Krona, an interactive browser that allows the exploration of hierarchical data with pie charts. You can also see the full data by downloading the report PDF's, found at the bottom of each output section.
