<p>EDGE is an easy to use, highly adaptable bioinformatics platform that allows laboratories to quickly analyze and interpret genomic sequence data that can be accessed and used from anywhere with an internet connection. The platform allows users to address a wide range of use cases including assay validation and the characterization of novel biological threats, clinical samples, and complex environmental samples. The goals of the EDGE platform are:</p>

<ul>
<li>To analyze and real world use cases</li>
<li>Make use of open source (free) software tools</li>
<li>Run analyses on small, relatively inexpensive hardware</li>
<li>Provide remote assistance from bioinformatics specialists</li>
</ul>
<p>
EDGE was designed for the role of a user-friendly bioinformatics solution that can be provided to OCONUS labs to facilitate successful adoption of High-Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies. This is critical because overseas deployment of sequencers allows the technology to get closer to the acquisition point of samples, thereby avoiding political issues associated with removal of strains/samples from host contries. In addition, sequencing specimens closer to the source can also decrease the timeline involved in identification and characterization of unknown agents, and acquisition of information that can be used against global health risks.

<h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How do I use EDGE?</h3>
<p>
To run EDGE, go to the EDGE webpage at <a href="https://www.bioedge.lanl.gov">www.bioedge.lanl.gov</a>. You will need to create an account in order to start a project, which you can do with the icon in the top right corner. Once you've created an account and have logged in, you can start a project. From the menu on the left, click "Run EDGE". This will open a page titled "Input your sample", and from here you will see a list of drop down menus that will allow you to label your project, input FASTQ files, and select the tools you would like to use. Pre-Processing, Assembly and Annotation, and Taxonomy Classification are turned on by default. 

For those that want to run EDGE offline, installation instructions can be found in our documentation, which can be accessed <a href="here">https://edge.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html</a>. There is also a link to the documentation on the EDGE website.
</p>

<h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is the output?</h3>
<p>
  After your project has completed its run, EDGE will create an output page that contains a summary of the run and the outputs of all tools used. This includes read reports, assembly reports, contig stats, and Krona plots.
